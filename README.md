Code files for project report
Very early stages of development

Commited the visualisation of incoming shoes from partners

The repository shows the implementation and analysis of datasets
to discover improvements for an external organisation. 
We were tasked to find ways to improve the current processes using data on the internet as well
as data provided by our client and find opportunities to improve their current processes. 
The analysis uses data taken from various sources so that we could
come to a conclusion as to finding the best course of action to optimising the shoe cleaning process.
This is our first time working together as a team and working for an organisation.
